```
visualize_optical_flow_hsv(flow)
```

Return the visualization of an optical flow vector `flow` in hsv color space.

Here, hue encodes angle between optical flow vector and the x-axis in the  image plane,
saturation encodes the ratio between the individual vector magnitudes and the maximum magnitude 
among the whole motion field.
