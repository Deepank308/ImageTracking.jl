```
visualize_flow(ColorBased(), flow)
```

Returns an image that matches the dimensions of the input matrix and that depicts the 
orientation and magnitude of the optical flow vectors using the HSV color space.

# Details
Hue encodes angle between optical flow vector and the x-axis in the image plane;
saturation encodes the ratio between the individual vector magnitudes and the maximum magnitude 
among the whole motion field, and the values always equal one.

# Arguments
The flow parameter needs to be a two-dimensional arrays of length-2 vectors (of type SVector) 
which represent the displacement of each pixel.
